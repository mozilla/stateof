  excerpt: 'More than ever, users need a trustworthy partner to guide them through a safer experience online, and that is the role Mozilla will play.',
  body: '<h3>A new product strategy for the age of AI and social</h3><p>The way we experience the Internet was defined for many years by the web browser and its underlying protocols, and that’s where Mozilla traditionally focused its efforts. But the rapid growth of AI and social networks have greatly expanded the threats to a safe and trustworthy online experience. Mozilla is transforming its product efforts to meet those needs</p><p>Navigating the digital world in a way that respects critical values like privacy, safety and choice has only grown harder. Bad actors are using the Internet to magnify division, promote hatred and manipulate facts and reality, while technology giants are collecting even more data to feed their AI and advertising models. More than ever, users need a trustworthy partner to guide them through a safer experience online, and that is the role Mozilla will play.</p><p>We will continue to invest in Firefox, Thunderbird and other products that millions of people know and love and evolve them with new features to help navigate this new landscape. But we are also expanding our efforts in social media and AI to show what’s possible when services are built for people over profit and to provide alternatives for those who seek them.</p><p>Our core mission remains the same: to enable an open and trustworthy internet where privacy is a right and control is in the hands of the many, not the few. But to achieve that we must tackle new areas and new challenges. Our products don’t need to dominate every market to make a difference, but we do need to turn our words into action and not merely criticize from the sidelines. We know from the hundreds of millions of people who use Mozilla products daily that there is demand for a better, safer online experience, and we will continue to meet that need.</p><p>Our product efforts now focus on three areas: web browsing; social media and content; and identity protection and security. We know we have a lot to do to effect real change in these areas, but our 25-year history of building secure, privacy-protecting technologies make us ideally positioned to lead the movement to a safer, more healthy online future.</p><p>It should be clear to everyone that our social spaces have been poisoned with divisiveness and misinformation, amplified by algorithms that reward outrage and hate for financial gain. We believe that open, decentralized social networks that prioritize well-being over clicks are not only possible but necessary, and will appeal to a large segment of users who share our concerns. So we are <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/mozilla-launch-fediverse-instance-social-media-alternative/" target="_blank">investing heavily</a> in the Fediverse to help make this a reality.</p><p>Unlike other social platforms, the Fediverse model moves power away from big tech companies and allows for a greater diversity of voices among platform builders. The Fediverse is being brought to life through services like <a href="https://www.noemamag.com/mastodon-isnt-just-a-replacement-for-twitter/" target="_blank">Mastodon</a>, <a href="https://matrix.org/" target="_blank">Matrix</a> and <a herf="https://pixelfed.org/" target="_blank">Pixelfed</a>. This year we <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/mozilla-social-mastodon-private-beta-announcement/" target="_blank">expanded our own service</a>, Mozilla.social, into a private beta. We will build on these efforts to provide social spaces that fulfill the potential of what a healthy online community can be.</p><h4>We believe that content moderation is essential and that “neutrality” is merely a ruse to drive monetization.</h4><p>Misinformation and harassment are harmful to individuals and society, and Mozilla.social will take an active stance to ensure that content on our platform adheres to our clear rules and does not undermine the public good.  This will not be popular with everyone, but we believe it’s the right thing to do. Many people are hungry for smaller, more moderated social spaces away from the cacophony of the wider Internet, and we will provide options for these smaller conversations as well as the ability to communicate widely.</p><p>We will also step up our efforts to protect identity and privacy, building on products like <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/products/vpn/" target="_blank">VPN</a>, <a href="https://relay.firefox.com/" target="_blank">Relay</a>, and <a href="https://monitor.firefox.com/" target="_blank">Monitor</a> to give users more control over how their personal data is used online. We all have a right to know how and where our digital identities are being used - and to withhold that information if we choose - and we will build new and expanded offerings to meet this need.</p><p>We have a particular duty to protect those who are vulnerable to hate and harassment. This includes communities like LGBTQ and female gamers, but also people now being targeted because of our charged political climate. Doctors, for example, are frequent targets of hate and Doxxing due to manufactured controversies around vaccines and reproductive health. We will develop ways to protect these individuals on social media and the wider internet.</p><p>Firefox remains the safest and most secure way to experience the web, and we will continue enhancing that product to address the increased challenges around safety and disinformation. This year we acquired Fakespot, a powerful tool that uses sophisticated machine learning algorithms to help identify fake reviews online and provide a safer shopping experience. We are embedding this capability into Firefox and will incorporate AI into the browser and other Mozilla products in ways that can provide real value to users. We see huge potential for AI, but it must be implemented in ways that serve the interests of people and not business.</p><p>We are at the start of a new chapter for Mozilla, one that may be even more challenging than the last. But we are moving with urgency because these issues must be tackled at once. The digital world is undergoing another rapid transformation, one that holds great promise but also carries significant risk. Our goal is to be the trusted partner that guides people through this new online world while serving as a beacon of safe and trustworthy design for others to follow.</p>'
