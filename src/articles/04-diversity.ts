  body: '<h3>Mozilla’s Boards play a key role in reclaiming the internet</h3><p>Mozilla is a rare player in the tech universe — a portfolio of nonprofit and commercial organizations aimed at the singular cause of putting people back in control of how the internet impacts their lives.</p><p>Our Boards of Directors play a key role in the pursuit of this goal. They help map out plans for new products and programs that will shape how the internet can be better in the future. They help us troubleshoot and evolve our thinking as the world changes around us. And, most importantly, they keep us on mission — helping us strike the right balance between the “pragmatic tech player” and “idealistic movement builder” sides of our personality.</p><blockquote>So we’re proud to share, in this report, the newest members of our Mozilla Foundation Board of Directors.</blockquote><p>As we have started to envisage Mozilla’s next 25 years, we have also looked to expand our Boards to bring new skills and perspectives. Today, we announce the appointment of Raffi Krikorian, Alondra Nelson, Edwin Macharia and Zain Habboo to the Board of the Mozilla Foundation.</p><p>Recently, there has been a good deal of discussion about nonprofit tech organizations and their Boards in the media. What’s often missing in the coverage is a clear explanation of the role tech nonprofits play in the world — and where we see successful examples of tech nonprofits and their Boards fulfilling a public purpose</p><p>As we say in the Mozilla Manifesto, the internet needs a mix of commercial and nonprofit players. Non-profit players serve the critical role of ensuring that technology like the internet and AI develop in a manner that benefits all humanity — and that critical digital infrastructure and standards are held as public assets that can be shared by all. Many successful examples have emerged over the last 20 years — the Wikimedia Foundation (which runs Wikipedia), the Linux Foundation (which houses many projects that provide stable and secure foundations for the internet) and, of course, Mozilla Foundation (which builds and advocates for an internet that optimizes for people over private interests).</p><p>All of these organizations are governed by Boards of Directors whose responsibility is to act in the public interest and to advance the mission of the organization they steward. In Mozilla’s case, there is a Board for the parent nonprofit, Mozilla Foundation, as well as separate Boards that oversee our wholly owned operating companies, like the Mozilla Corporation. This design is specific to Mozilla. Different Boards have different functions within our overall portfolio, allowing us to bring in a mix of experience, background and skill suited to the task at hand. This diversity is critical to our success and to our culture.</p><p>The Foundation Board,which guides the overall direction of Mozilla and holds the portfolio companies accountable for advancing the manifesto, oversees our philanthropic and advocacy work and appoints members to the Boards of our operating companies,has always had a mix of members from both the social and technology sectors. With an increased focus on AI, we have decided to expand this Board to include more expertise about AI and involvement from people who work with communities impacted by it. We asked the Board members to reflect on why they joined Mozilla:</p><p><ul><li>Raffi Krikorian, CTO at the Emerson Collective: “There are so many questions around AI, but the path forward is to promote transparency and open source — precisely what Mozilla is pushing to do.”</li><li>Alondra Nelson, former Acting Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy: “Organizations like Mozilla that are committed to working in the public interest are critical if we want to create rights-preserving, trustworthy AI.”</li><li>Edwin Macharia, former Managing Director at Dalberg: “Social enterprises like Mozilla have the potential to create real double bottom line impact, balancing both mission and money.”</li><li>Zain Habboo, Chief Marketing Officer at the International Rescue Committee: “Communities — especially the most vulnerable — impacted by AI need to have a voice in the design of AI. Mozilla is making sure this happens.”</li></ul></p><p>These new Board members join the current slate of Foundation Board members, which includes: Mitchell Baker, Mozilla Foundation Chair and CEO of the Mozilla Corporation; Brian Behlendorf, Chief AI Strategist at the Linux Foundation; Amy Keating, Chief Legal Officer of Planet Labs; Mark Surman, President and Executive Director of Mozilla Foundation; Helen Turvey, former CEO, Shuttleworth Foundation; and Nicole Wong, former US Deputy Chief Technology Officer.</p><p>Over the last several years, we’ve added new members to the Mozilla Corporation Board as well. These are civic-minded tech leaders who bring experience and skills that are tuned to building successful, responsible tech products. They include people with deep experience in: <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/kristin-skogen-lund-mozilla-board-announcement/" target="_blank">multiproduct portfolio companies</a> like Schibsted; <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/why-im-joining-mozillas-board-of-directors-2/" target="_blank">consumer internet products</a> like eBay, and Airbnb; <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/kerry-w-cooper-mozilla-board-of-directors/" target="_blank">consumer marketing at companies</a> like Levis; and <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/news/hugh-molotsi-why-im-joining-mozillas-board-of-directors/" target="_blank">building innovation programs</a> within tech companies like Intuit.</p><p>We deliberately construct our Boards of Directors so that voices from across the tech community, regulatory circles, academia, and global populations — including those that are too often not represented — have a presence at the table and play a role in our strategic decision-making. This approach to engaging with the outside world is one of those things that separates us from the tech industry at large and ensures that our work continues to put benefit to people above profit to ourselves.</p><p>There has been a good deal of discussion about nonprofit tech companies and their Boards recently. While some recent experiments with models like these have failed to create lasting institutions serving the public, Mozilla — and others like it — have stood the test of time. We believe the world — and the internet — needs more successful organizations like this, not less. Getting the right mix of people in Board roles is key to this kind of success.</p><p><a href="https://www.mozilla.org/about/leadership/#boards" target="_blank" class="flex !no-underline items-center gap-[5px]"><span class="text-[16px]/[28px] font-bold relative font-title group hover:!text-black">See more about our Boards on mozilla.org<span class="bottom-0 left-0 w-full h-0.5 bg-black absolute transition duration-150 ease-out group-hover:scale-x-0 origin-right"></span></span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 13 12" class="w-[14px] transition duration-150 ease-out group-hover:translate-x-1"><path fill="#000" d="M6.69318.36364 12.4205 6.0909 6.69318 11.8182 5.375 10.5114l3.46023-3.46026H.72727V5.13068h8.10796L5.375 1.67614 6.69318.36364Z" /></svg></div></p>'
