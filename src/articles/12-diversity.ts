  excerpt: 'we’re proud to share, in this report, the newest members of our Mozilla Foundation Board of Directors.',
  body: '<p>The boards of directors at Mozilla, for the Foundation, the Corporation, Ventures, and Mozilla.ai, are key elements in our goal of ensuring Mozilla’s work brings benefit to humanity above all else. Given the internet’s potential for society-wide impact, particularly through the power of AI, we think the importance of this multi-perspective approach is only growing.</p><p>No one person can adequately represent the concerns of populations around the world whose lives are being changed by the internet, so we don’t ask anyone Mozilla to try to undertake this impossible task. The world of technology, and its fundamental role in society, is evolving too quickly. Instead, we look to supplement the genius we have within Mozilla with genius, perspective, and experience from outside.</p><p>We deliberately construct our Boards of Directors so that voices from other areas of the tech community, regulatory circles, academia, and global populations that are too often not represented, have a presence at the table and play a role in our strategic decision-making. This approach to engaging with the outside world is one of those things that separates us from the tech industry at large and ensures that our work continues to put benefit to people above profit to ourselves.</p><p>So we’re proud to share, in this report, the newest members of our Mozilla Foundation Board of Directors. When we began our search earlier this, we were looking for three new Board members to help grow the scope and impact of the Mozilla Project overall. Working closely with the Boards of the Mozilla Corporation, Mozilla.ai, and Mozilla Ventures. We ended up finding four.</p><p><strong>Alondra Nelson</strong> is the Harold F.
