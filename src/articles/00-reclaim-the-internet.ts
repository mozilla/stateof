  body: '<h3>Significant changes in our world — shifts in public opinion, public policy and products — often seem to happen organically, as if they were destined.</h3><p>Mozilla is on a journey to help people reclaim the internet. We think technology should be designed and built to serve the people who use it. We think people should control their data, not technology providers. We think social media should be a safe space, free from content that is harmful and false.</p><p>And we aren’t alone in wanting more transparency and accountability in the industry. We’re collaborating with developers, activists, artists, entrepreneurs, researchers and others around the world to design tech that serves people and not corporations. We’re working on technology that reflects the diversity of people and cultures in the world. The rapid rise of Artificial Intelligence presents opportunities and risks if not developed responsibly and we are focused on building products and creating an ecosystem around trustworthy AI with open source principles at the core.</p><p>It’s early stages in this journey, but this movement will counterbalance the entrenched tech companies who’ve built empires on the data and trust of the public.</p>'
