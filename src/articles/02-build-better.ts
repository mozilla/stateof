  body: '<h3>The State of Mozilla</h3><p>In my letter last year, I said that Mozilla had to be bigger, bolder and do more if we are going to play a role shaping the internet of tomorrow. I’m happy to say that we’ve made progress against that vision in the last 12 months. Throughout this report, you will see signs of a Mozilla that’s moving in the right direction.</p><p>Mark Surman outlines an expansion of Mozilla as a whole, with the launch of new entities focused on venture investing and open source AI. Mohamed Nanabhay and Moez Draief provide more detailed looks at the first days of these two new organizations. Steve Texeira gives more insight into our product vision, new markets we’re exploring and how our acquisition of Fakespot helps us accelerate our goals. Imo Udom and J. Bob Alotta share exciting updates on how we are expanding our engagement with communities and builders around the world.</p><p>This is a report full of progress, signs of a strong start as we pursue the changes I outlined last year. But it’s not enough. The pace is not enough, the impact is not enough. Yet.</p><p>As much as Mozilla has changed in the last year, the world we work within has changed even more. AI has exploded onto the scene, moving from idea to consumer-products at an incredible pace. With it has come heightened concern about tech’s role in our lives and a flurry of regulatory activities in response.</p><blockquote>That openness and willingness to put the safety and interests of people first is how we built the trust we now enjoy. And it is how we will approach new opportunities to set better standards for the internet.</blockquote><p>The progress we have made is good, it’s given us momentum, but we need more and we need it faster. So in this report, you will see signs of progress as well as a focus on where we are going and what we need to do. We’re actively working with open source developers in AI, and will double down to protect and enhance the critical role this community should play in AI’s evolution. We’ve re-engaged with communities beyond Mozilla — using events like MozFest to gather everyone from activists, to developers, to entrepreneurs, to creators and regulators — who are challenging the status quo across domains.</p><div class="flex flex-col md:flex-row items-start justify-between gap-[70px] mt-[100px]"><div class="relative w-full"><svg class="md:absolute top-0 right-0 w-full translate-x-5 md:translate-z-0 md:w-[450px]" viewBox="0 0 457 437" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g clip-path="url(#clip1_878_4028)"><path style="mix-blend-mode:multiply" d="M452 148L138.024 573H-45L268.976 148L452 148Z" fill="#1AC5F4"/><rect style="mix-blend-mode:multiply" width="336" height="336" rx="168" fill="#1AC5F4"/></g><defs><clipPath id="clip1_878_4028"><rect width="573" height="573" fill="white"/></clipPath></defs></svg></div><div class="md:w-2/3 shrink-0"><h3>We’ve reinvigorated our product development engine and made difficult choices to shut down projects and change teams when needed.</h3><p>We’ve taken our first steps to build and test data-rich and AI-based offerings that are constructed from a starting point of trustworthiness.</p><p>And we’ve rallied millions of regular users around the idea of trustworthy AI, with campaigns like YouTube Regrets Reporter encouraging companies like YouTube to improve their algorithms and publications like <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/privacynotincluded/" target="_blank">*Privacy Not Included</a> calling  on car companies to respect our privacy.</p><p>So, we started to ship fixes as soon as an issue was discovered. We shared what was found and the solution we applied. We went a step further, creating the industry’s first bug bounty program. We actively encouraged people to find vulnerabilities within Firefox, to share them with us so we could fix them and rewarded them when they did so. This is now the industry standard.</p><p>That openness and willingness to put the safety and interests of people first is how we built the trust we now enjoy. And it is how we will approach new opportunities to set better standards for the internet. In AI certainly, but also in society, where an organization owned by a not-for-profit has an opportunity to radically change the incentives that have so corrupted social to date, also in data, we must recognize that our own approach has to evolve.</p><p>This is good, but it’s not yet enough. We need to be faster in prototyping, launching, learning and iterating. We need more in market, to learn from the market and respond to the market, because our ability to shape the tech landscape comes from the success of our products when they’re in consumers’ hands.</p><p>This requires rich data, and so we will be moving in that direction, but in a very Mozilla way, always prioritizing user privacy and leveraging the latest in encryption and other protective measures. As we did with bugs, we will look not to follow the practices of the industry as they exist today but to set new and better ones.</p><p>We need to act on the fact that our long track record of trust, of putting people ahead of profit, gives us permission to take more risks and move more quickly. As long as we always put our mission first.</p><p>We enter our 26th year with our eyes wide open to the challenge ahead, and more convinced than ever that Mozilla was built for exactly a moment like this.</p></div></div>'
