  excerpt: 'Through this new program, we are annually honoring the group of activists, builders, artists, creators and advocates who are reshaping the internet.',
  body: '<p>In 2023, we celebrated our first cohort of Rise25 honorees. Through this new program, we are annually honoring the group of activists, builders, artists, creators and advocates who are reshaping the internet. They are building products or movements, standing up for civil rights, blowing the whistle on powerful companies, and starting companies to push back against extremism, bullying and surveillance online. This diverse group all has have a few important things in common: they are standing solving problems, standing up for the overlooked by the tech industry, and they deeply care about the future of the internet.</p><p>We brought together this cohort in Berlin this October to honor them and the contributions they are making, and will be working alongside them in the future to continue making sure the internet is a force for good.</p><p>“It was a great honor that made my team and everyone we have worked with on improving digital rights very happy. It is of course also motivating to receive such recognition. Meeting all the other honorees expanded my understanding on all the different things people can do to improve the internet, but also the world.” - Finn Myrstad, Rise25 honoree & director of digital policy at the Norwegian consumer council (NCC).</p><p>“Celebrating Rise25 with fellow honorees in Berlin was one word; inspirational. A collective of individuals each shaping and redefining the internet, an unforgettable experience for each of us.” - Kay Lopez, Founder of Latinas Poderosas</p><p>"Mozilla has been a leader in prioritizing safety and placing the consumer first for 25 years, paving the way for organizations like #HalfTheStory. We are honored to partner Mozilla and Rise 25 as the initial step in elevating our work to make digital wellness accessible to everyone on the internet." - Larissa May, Rise25 honoree & Founder of #HalfTheStory</p><p>“Being named a MozillaRise 25 honoree was incredibly validating and so very special. In particular, to me, it represented an affirmation of the need for more young people, especially young women of color (and other individuals from historically underrepresented backgrounds) leading the charge towards realizing a more safe, kind internet. So much of what’s made my work so effective is rooted in my perspective as a young person -- and there are so many more young people out there with amazing ideas to build a better internet. I hope that this recognition inspires them to bring those ideas to life.” -Trisha Prabhu, Rise25 honoree & Founder and CEO of ReThink</p><p>“Becoming a Mozilla Rise25 honoree is a profound affirmation of standing on the shoulders of my ancestors’ wildest dreams. It’s a recognition of the legacy of black women who, throughout history, have been silently changing the world, yet often overlooked. Working with Mozilla means seizing the opportunity to amplify these voices, to ensure that our contributions are not only acknowledged but celebrated. The Rise25 award ceremony in Berlin was a poignant reminder that we are not alone in this journey. Together, we continue to shatter barriers and pave the way for a future where all black women in tech are seen, heard, and honored.” - Nyamekye Wilson, Rise25 honoree & founder and CEO of Black Sisters in STEM</p>'
