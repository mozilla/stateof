  body: '<h3>Fostering Open Systems, Diversity and Trustworthy AI through Community</h3><p>At Mozilla, we understand the importance of bringing people and communities together to solve paramount  issues with technology. Our approach has always been to create open systems and work with others to foster collective innovation. Now, we’re building a movement with many facets, crossing global borders and cultures, and representing the diversity of people and ideas that make up our digital world.</p><p>To start with, we’re partnering with a global community of developers who want to build software for a more inclusive internet and responsible AI systems. Building AI tools that prioritize people and not profits isn’t easy, so AI developers have been using closed models that aren’t open or able to be scrutinized for bias and other problems. To tackle this problem, we’re working with AI safety experts and champions of ethical software engineering to create an ecosystem that will prioritize core trustworthy AI principles.</p><p>We outlined those principles in our Trustworthy AI white paper two years ago: reliable and controllable; transparent and explainable; data protection; delineation of responsibility and inclusiveness. Now, we’re making the ideas more concrete and actionable with the launch of an <a href="https://ai-guide.future.mozilla.org/" target="_blank">AI Guide</a> that can serve as a resource for sharing best practices. The AI Guide is a place where Mozilla and AI developers can share information, learnings, and best practices that will help everyone in the community operationalize the principles.</p><p>We feel that the purpose of technology is to solve problems and uplift people. That happens best when people are building technology to meet their own needs. That’s why we expanded our <a href="https://future.mozilla.org/builders-challenge/" target="_blank">Responsible AI Challenge</a> to Kenya and India. The program provides funding for universities to integrate ethics and social responsibility into computer science curricula. It is designed to empower undergraduate students to take a multidisciplinary approach in their research as they build systems to address systemic inequities that tech can enable. The program, accomplished in partnership with other organizations, has awarded millions of dollars to developers, as well as holds workshops and training to help get them up to speed on regulation, safety and other considerations when developing AI.</p><p>Our commitment to providing opportunities to people and cultivating talent extends beyond the Responsible AI Challenge. We support outliers who are risk-takers shaping the technology that will make a difference in our lives in ways legacy tech hasn’t. Our Fellowship program has provided more than $20 million to 200 people who are doing work to address issues that pose a threat to a safe, healthy online experience for people around the world. Three Mozilla Fellows were named to TIME’s 100 Most Influential People list this year, a sign that efforts to support changemakers pays off.</p><p>As Mozilla turned 25 this year, we launched the Rise 25 initiative to <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/rise-25-winners/" target="_blank">recognize</a> 25 artists, communicators, creators and others who are shaping the future of the internet to be more ethical, responsible and inclusive. And we formed the <a href="https://future.mozilla.org/mieco/" target="_blank">Mozilla Internet Ecosystem (MIECO) Program</a>, which provides mentorship and funds groundbreaking projects aimed at building a healthier internet. So far, we’ve funded 12 innovators through the program to help shape the future of the internet in new and interesting ways. We’re also funding research and technology in Kenya and South Africa as part of our African Innovation Mradi program.</p><p>Mozilla Foundation has many other avenues for putting the ills of the internet under a microscope and exploring solutions. The Data Futures Lab is looking at new approaches to data stewardship, providing funding and holding a collaborative space to workshop ideas for giving people more control over their data. We also just launched season 7 of our award-winning IRL podcast. This season we talk to people who want to change the AI equation and put technology to work for the people.</p><p>It’s important for us to create spaces where people can connect and collaborate on solving some of the biggest tech problems today. Those spaces can be virtual or in-person, such as the MozFest series of events we sponsor that explore the intersection of tech and society. We held them in locations around the world this year, including Berlin, Nairobi and Amsterdam.</p><p>The Mozilla Foundation aims to be a safe harbor and nurturer for scholars, technologists and others with big ideas that can make a difference in the world.</p>'
