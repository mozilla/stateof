  body: '<h3>Our Vision to Reclaim the Internet</h3><p>We recognize the internet as an extraordinary force for good. It can be a canvas for human expression, a library with unlimited books, a town square for global discussion, and a vast arena for the articulation of culture and ideas. Yet, despite its potential, the internet has also given rise to challenges that cannot be ignored. Centralized control, privacy invasions, and the erosion of user choice have cast long shadows over the utilization, benefit, and enjoyment of the internet.</p><p>For a quarter century, Mozilla has been at the forefront of building a better internet. We’ve worked to create products that respect privacy, champion open standards, and keep the web accessible to all. But the work is far from over. As the internet continues to evolve, so does our approach to protecting and empowering its users.</p><h3>The core of our vision</h3><p>The Mozilla brand is strong, and for 25 years, it has served as a beacon for internet health and been a lightning rod for attention on how tech companies should act. As we move into the next 25 years, our brand must continue to grow to reflect the changing technology environment.</p><p>"Reclaim the Internet" is a call to action. It’s an invitation to join forces in reclaiming agency over our digital lives. Mozilla envisions fulfilling the Internet’s inherent promises — connection, opportunity and advancement that form the bedrock of the internet’s very concept.</p><p>This idea is our cause for action and is anchored in our history. Regardless of identity or origin, everyone deserves the chance to experience the web as they wish. Control over our time, expression, privacy and community is not just a luxury; it’s a right. The internet should be a catalyst for wonder, not disillusionment.</p><p>"Reclaim the Internet" is a multifaceted approach to reimagining our digital future. It encompasses:</p><ul><li><strong>Revitalizing our brand identity:</strong> Emphasizing the tagline "Reclaim the Internet" across all our communications and product offerings.</li><li><strong>Expanding advocacy efforts:</strong> Leading policy dialogues and community movements aimed at democratizing the internet’s control structures.</li><li><strong>Innovating with purpose:</strong> Developing and refining our products to align with our vision of a reclaimed internet.</li><li><strong>Engaging our global community:</strong> Mobilizing our vast network of users, developers, and advocates to partake in this pivotal movement.</li></ul><h3>The way forward</h3><p>Mozilla is prioritizing efforts to advocate for internet users everywhere. We’re not just talking; we’re doing.</p><p>We’re building new products and technologies that prioritize users over profits and supporting others who share our vision for an open internet. It’s not just about offering alternatives; it’s about setting new standards for what technology companies should be.</p><blockquote>And most importantly, we’re giving you the freedom to choose — to opt for products that align with your values and your needs. We believe everyone should have the power to shape their online experience, control their personal data, and navigate the web on their own terms.</blockquote><div class="flex flex-col md:flex-row items-start justify-between gap-[70px] mt-[100px]"><div class="relative w-full"><svg class="md:absolute top-0 right-0 w-full translate-x-5 md:translate-z-0 md:w-[450px]" viewBox="0 0 457 437" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g clip-path="url(#clip0_878_4692)"><path opacity="0.5" d="M7.81321e-07 66L457 66L457 370.844L7.81321e-07 66Z" fill="#48EA83"/><path opacity="0.5" d="M100 284C100 212.755 157.755 155 229 155V155C300.245 155 358 212.755 358 284V437H100V284Z" fill="#48EA83"/><path style="mix-blend-mode:multiply" opacity="0.8" d="M223 99.5164C223 44.555 267.555 0 322.516 0V0C377.478 0 422.033 44.555 422.033 99.5164V99.5164C422.033 154.478 377.478 199.033 322.516 199.033V199.033C267.555 199.033 223 154.478 223 99.5164V99.5164Z" fill="#48EA83"/></g><defs><clipPath id="clip0_878_4692"><rect width="457" height="437" fill="white"/></clipPath></defs></svg></div><div class="md:w-2/3 shrink-0"><h3>How we act</h3><p>We find ourselves in an era where advocacy is more critical than ever. The internet, a resource that should be as free and open as the air we breathe, is at risk of becoming privatized and closed. Mozilla is taking a stand. We are not just participating in the conversation, but leading the charge for change. Our policy and advocacy work is shaping a future where users, not corporations, have a say in how the internet is run.</p><h3>How we build</h3><p>We believe in an internet that serves the people. To that end, we’re building products that do just that. Mozilla’s product suite is designed to give users control of their online experience. From browsers, to AI, to social platforms, we’re at the forefront of producing technologies that safeguard privacy, ensure security, and promote openness. We’re also investing in partnerships with companies and developers who are building products that align with our vision and spirit.</p><h3>How we choose</h3><p>Choice is the essence of freedom, and on the internet, the freedom to choose is paramount. Mozilla provides real choice for people; offering products that allow users to navigate the web on their own terms. We empower individuals to choose services that respect their data, provide transparent operations, and put people over profits. Our products are a testament to our belief that everyone should have the power to shape their digital lives.</p><h3>A journey we take together</h3><p>“Reclaim” is a very deliberate choice, because it is the action we all so clearly need to take. The internet once belonged to all of us. It was a place where we could build connections and relationships with people who share our interests, where we could discover something new and exciting, where we could be exposed to and immersed in parts of the world we would never have otherwise encountered. The internet was as big as the world that was building it.</p><p>The internet today has abandoned a lot of that early promise and wonder. Our experiences on the internet are defined by the profit we generate for corporations. What we get to see is determined by mysterious algorithms designed first for the benefit of the companies that create them. Who we can interact with is defined by the voices that are most outrageous, most likely to draw views, clicks, and responses, and therefore most likely to generate advertising dollars. The internet has become smaller.</p><p>We need to take back the internet and reclaim our agency online. Our ability to express ourselves, our means of building our own communities, our options to define and protect our individual privacy, our opportunity to discover new things and people that expand our view of the world rather than reinforce our existing perceptions.</p><p>Mozilla’s mission is as vital today as it was when we were founded 25 years ago, and the stakes are just as high. And just as we always have, we look to tackle the challenges before us by energizing the surrounding community, and in Reclaim the Internet, we believe we’ve found a cry that rallies us all.</p><p>As Chris Smalls, President of the Amazon Labor Union, said at our Rise 25 event in Berlin in October, “No amount of money can compete with the power of people when we come together.”</p><p>It’s time to reimagine our digital future. Let’s go Reclaim the Internet.</p></div></div>'
