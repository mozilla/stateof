  body: '<p>At Mozilla, our quest is rooted in our deep commitment to forging a better internet and placing people at the forefront of our mission. Unlike traditional technology corporations, we intertwine business with purpose, seeing our operations as a means to connect with people, enrich their lives, and contribute to a brighter internet future.</p><p>Our unique structure, encompassing a non-profit organization and a for-profit company, coupled with a vibrant global community, positions us uniquely to achieve our mission. The Mozilla Foundation, the sole owner of the Mozilla Corporation, enables us to prioritize internet users’ welfare over profit-driven motives.</p><p>In 2023, we solidified the diversification journey we embarked upon in 2019. We ended the year on a high note, with our revenue-generating products experiencing growth and solid financial footing for both the Foundation and the Corporation. Our new product offerings not only contributed to our revenues but also set privacy-respecting precedents for the industry. The Foundation’s steadfast commitment to its mission and public engagement to advance internet health remained strong, bolstered by a wave of new talent.</p><p>Now, let’s delve into the details of our finances that allowed us to continue our mission. In 2022, we achieved a marginal increase in our revenue, driven by our strategic objective to diversify our revenue base. This diversification included a reevaluation of our relationship with Google and was complemented by mindful investments in our operations, which, while reducing our profitability, aligned with our mission. This investment strategy included infusing capital into new businesses, balancing our marketing and product development, and acquiring companies like Active Replica and Pulse to bolster our product offerings.</p><p>Aa a core In a strategic move to enhance our product offerings, we recently acquired Fakespot, a company renowned for its innovative approach to tackling fake reviews on shopping websites through state-of-the-art machine learning technology. Currently available as an add-on for Firefox and other browsers, as well as a mobile app, Fakespot is set to become an integral part of the Firefox user experience. With plans underway to develop unique Fakespot integrations specifically tailored for Firefox users, we are taking significant strides to equip our customers with the tools they need to navigate through deceptive online reviews, ultimately enhancing their online shopping experience. This acquisition is a clear reflection of our commitment to positioning Firefox as the browser that truly puts the customer experience first.</p><p>Attracting and retaining users is also fundamental to our long-term success.  We understand the importance of a positive initial customer experience, and as such, we are continually enhancing our Desktop and Mobile products to not only attract new users but also retain our existing user base. By leveraging data-driven insights and implementing product improvements, we aim to reduce churn and provide a seamless, enriching online experience that meets the needs and expectations of our users.</p><p>Our commitment to ethical advertising is also a fundamental aspect of our mission at Mozilla. Recognizing the necessity of a digital advertising platform that aligns with our values, we are currently developing a system that emphasizes user privacy, transparency, and ethical practices. This investment is a testament to our unwavering dedication to cultivating a trustworthy online environment, where both advertisers and users can thrive in a transparent and ethical digital space</p><p>Regarding our corporate capitalization, over the past two years, we’ve recalibrated our approach to align our asset stewardship with our long-term financial support for our mission, always ensuring alignment with our core principles. This recalibration includes adopting a quasi-endowment approach to managing our overall cash and marketable securities, aiming for an optimized balance of risk and return. We’ve also implemented a framework to track the mission alignment of our investments, responsibly vote our proxies, and weigh the trade-offs between mission and return.</p><p>In summary, our advancements over the last year demonstrate our commitment to continuing to grow and evolve as an organization, underscoring our unwavering commitment to creating a safer, more transparent, and user-centric internet. From our dedication to ethical advertising and user acquisition to our groundbreaking integration with Fakespot, we continue to uphold our core values, ensuring our users have the best possible online experience.</p><p>Together, we are shaping the future of the internet, and we are excited to share our journey with you in this report.</p>'
