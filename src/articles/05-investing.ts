  excerpt: 'Over the last year, as we’ve seen generative AI tools used for good and for harm, the need for technology built with the interests of people at the forefront has never been needed more.',
  body: '<h3>Investing in Startups That Are Building Responsible Technology</h3><p>When we announced Mozilla Ventures and its $35 million fund a year ago, we were looking to provide support to startups aligned with our values of working toward a healthier internet as outlined in our <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/" target="blank">Mozilla Manifesto</a>. Over the last year, as we’ve seen generative AI tools used for good and for harm, the need for technology built with the interests of people at the forefront has never been needed more. </p><p>Mozilla has been building open source technology for a long time and now is focusing on developing AI technology that solves big problems and protects people’s privacy on the internet. But we can’t build it all ourselves. With Mozilla Ventures, we are fostering an ecosystem around these ideals and providing like-minded entrepreneurs and startups with capital, expertise and assistance to support their mission. So far, we’ve invested in 28 companies from around the globe and we’re exploring more.</p><p>For the hundreds of startups and entrepreneurs we’ve met with, our vetting process isn’t like that of most VC firms. We go beyond scrutinizing the business fundamentals and market potential and ask ourselves: Is this a company that is advancing technology we think is important and should exist in the world? We use the Manifesto as a lens to help us make our investing decisions focused on three thematic areas: trustworthy AI; security and privacy; and healthy communities. </p><h4>The founders we’ve invested in are as diverse as the products they are building</h4><p>For example, South African Pelonomi Moiloa, CEO and Co-founder of <a target="_blank" href="https://lelapa.ai/">Lelapa AI</a>, is working to extend natural language processing to languages spoken in Africa so millions of people currently not served by the technology can benefit from it. Pelonomi, whose bigger goal is to grow the pool of AI researchers in and product offerings in Africa, was recognized as one of <a href="https://time.com/collection/time100-ai/6309035/pelonomi-moiloa/" target="_blank">TIME Magazine’s 100 Most Influential People</a> this year.</p><p>Another portfolio company is <a href="https://www.bluefever.com/" target="_blank">Blue Fever</a>, a social well-being platform that uses pseudonyms to protect peoples’ identities. It’s targeted at Gen Z and Millennials, demographics that have seen a huge jump in mental health issues in recent years. <a href="https://www.themisai.io/" target="_blank">Themis AI</a> is helping to improve reliability in machine language models. In the healthcare space, <a href="https://arrayinsights.com/" target="_blank">Array Insights</a> is creating AI technology to help medical researchers prevent, treat and cure diseases while protecting patient data. <a hreg="https://bionic.ai/" target="_blank">Bionic</a> uses AI to help companies keep their cloud environments secure. And <a href="https://www.pindo.io/" target="_blank">Pindo</a>’s technology is helping improve communication systems in Africa, enabling underserved communities to have more access and connection. There are many others, all sharing the desire to build responsible technology that pushes the market in a more positive direction.</p>'
