  excerpt: null,
  body: '<h4>Making the Internet healthy, open and more private, is at the very heart of the Mozilla manifesto and our two decade track record of working to build a better web. We’ve frequently spoken out against data practices in advertising that are seemingly designed to prioritize the interests of companies over people. We’ve even limited our own participation due to our strict, privacy-centric viewpoint, but that doesn’t imply we’ve ever been anti-advertising.</h4><p>Our vision is to create an advertising experience that sits at the intersection of privacy and efficacy. Like everything we do, privacy is not something we’re bolting on after-the-fact. We’re committed to building a digital advertising platform that upholds our pledge for a healthier Internet and adheres to the following:</p><p><ul><li>Puts people first before profits</li><li>Does not discriminate or divide</li><li>Promotes industry participation and innovation</li><li>Strikes the balance between commercial profit and public benefit</li></ul></p><p>When it comes to advertising technology, we have two options: either we continue to adapt — using as much data as legally allowed — or we change course — moving toward a newer, better model with privacy built-in from the start. So, as the advertising industry sits at a fork in the road with the end of third-party cookies, we ask ourselves: how do we build a better Internet – and what does privacy-respecting advertising have to do with it?</p><p>Most of the content and services we enjoy today are funded by advertising, which enables the Internet to be free and open. But the online world is ever-changing, as is the relationship between browser users, online service providers, and tensions with data protection authorities.</p><p>The explosive growth of personal data usage and sharing has created legitimate concerns about the potential exploitation of personal information. This includes the collection and distribution of sensitive data – data that might reference private medical conditions or financial information to third-parties without proper safeguards or even consent from the persons the information belongs to – fundamentally altering the way people, businesses, and governments view privacy.</p><p>With increasing regulatory scrutiny and the deprecation of third-party cookies – something we’ve long supported – businesses aim to adapt and ensure their ability to continue advertising and achieving marketing goals, regardless of the changing landscape. There are nearly 10,000 "Chief Privacy Officers" on LinkedIn alone calling for reform to online advertising. It may appear that everyone is rethinking advertising through a privacy lens these days. Especially (and paradoxically) when many of the biggest online businesses are spending millions to demonstrate that they are serious about consumer privacy concerns.</p><p>Mozilla is uniquely suited to lead this change, but we’ll be the first to admit that our privacy-centric stance of keeping personal data with the individual initially limited our influence to set an example for a more balanced approach, one that acknowledges the crucial role of data in building better products and generating revenue on the Internet today.</p><blockquote>Our distinct advantage is that we’re accountable to a non-profit, the Mozilla Foundation, rather than corporate shareholders.</blockquote><p>Bearing in mind our purpose is to fund our operations and support the Mozilla Foundation, rather than generate increasing returns to shareholders, our incentives are vastly different from those that have influenced the market thus far. As both an advocacy and an advertising-benefitting organization, we’re carefully examining how advertising is done today, and learning to operate in a way that puts privacy first, designing bespoke solutions in our own products that are privacy-respecting above all – this is a unique opportunity that no other advertising platform has had before.</p><p>In developing our own advertising platform built on privacy, our objective is to define effective privacy-respecting ad measurement and attribution. Striking a balance between advertisers, publishers, and consumers is a fine line to walk, and as a marketer ourselves, our goal is to demonstrate that efficiency and privacy aren’t mutually exclusive.</p><p>And we are only at the beginning of this journey. Within the next year we can expect to begin more thorough experimentation and are committed to publicly sharing our learnings. We’re fortunate to possess a range of products, such as the Firefox browser, Mozilla’s Pocket, Mozilla Social, MDN Web Docs, and others, which allow us to experiment by becoming our own first customer and improving these technologies before expanding further. In fact, <a href="https://www.fakespot.com/" target="_blank">Fakespot</a>, which aims to help consumers avoid fake reviews, is a recent example where we’re exploring targeting products instead of people. This enables us to share relevant advertisements with consumers, while also providing a more trustworthy shopping experience.</p><p>This work is especially important at a time where Mozilla is significantly expanding our product portfolio and markets we want to explore, including our long-term investment in Mozilla.Social amongst other products, which means there will be additional platforms and opportunities to advertise.</p><p>Defining the future of privacy-respecting advertising is a huge undertaking that will include major contributions from all areas of our business as well as engagement with outside partners and industry players. With the rate at which the industry is evolving, there may never be a day when we can simply say, "mission accomplished." The advertising industry will always have a multitude of both interesting and gnarly problems, but we’re motivated to work with others in industry to find solutions to them and can assure you that there will be no shortage of progress ahead of us.</p>'
