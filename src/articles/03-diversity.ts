  body: '<h3>The State of Mozilla</h3><p>If you’re reading this letter, I don’t need to convince you of the critical role Mozilla has played in shaping the internet for the better over the last 25 years. Instead, I want to focus on where the internet stands today, the challenges shaping its next quarter century, and the vital role Mozilla will continue to play in creating a better internet for us all.</p><p>The internet, while no longer in its infancy, is still an evolving beast, full of potential and pitfalls. We are at a pivotal moment, with the rise of AI changing the landscape in profound ways. This change brings the promise of powerful benefits but also significant risks. As with any technical advancement, it’s worth applying a skeptical eye to the voices at either end of the spectrum. Those who only sing of the potential upside do so in complete ignorance of the lessons taught to us by the last 30 years of tech development. Many of those spinning tales to terrify us do so in an attempt to regulate a powerful few into dominance over this technology, leaving the mass of humanity outside of the potential benefits.</p><p>As we have learned, what is often most important at this early stage in a new technology’s development is work to ensure that the mass of humanity feels its benefits, not just the privileged few. And that the risks of unfettered development are intelligently mitigated in a way that encourages and promotes competition writ large, not simply among a few giant companies. Mozilla’s work in AI began more than five years ago, focused on exactly these issues, because we see in AI the potential to expand the great equalizing force of the internet to even more people and communities and, critically, the opportunity to finally put power and agency in the hands of the communities themselves.</p><p>Take, for example, Kiazi Bora app developed with the Mozilla Common Voice program. This app, using AI voice technology, has a profound impact on a specific community – sweet potato farmers in Kenya. It provides advice, insights, and communities for farmers to optimize their crops and grow their products in a way that can maximize returns. It’s the exact type of discrete yet transformative invention that will not be possible if competition in AI isn’t protected. A trillion-dollar company is unlikely ever to build a tool for these farmers, and yet, it’s precisely this kind of innovation that can make a real difference in people’s lives.</p><p>Our mission remains as significant as it was a quarter-century ago, and the chorus of voices urging us to do more is ever-growing. As we set our sights on the horizon, it is essential to take a moment to reflect on our current standing. Our opportunities are intertwined with challenges, and there are moments when the path ahead feels overwhelming, even impossible.</p><h4>And just as for the past 25 years, our identity remains our compass.</h4><p>It continues to guide us through thick and thin, enabling us to transform obstacles into stepping stones. Mozilla’s unique blend – our mission, our aspirations, our technological prowess, and our commitment to adding value to people’s daily lives – has been the recipe for our past successes.</p><p>When discussing navigating the digital terrain, we’re often pitted against tech behemoths. The challenge is clear: How do we provide superior online experiences when competing against these giants? They have deeper pockets, larger platforms, and a pervasive presence. While public trust in these entities might be eroding, their grip on the digital ecosystem remains tight.</p><p>However, our strength lies in the trust people have in Mozilla. This trust is our most valuable asset, something we have built over decades of doing what’s right and setting new standards for the internet that favor the people who use it over the corporations who look to exploit it. One of the earliest examples of this was how we approached bugs within Firefox. At the time, the standard set by our competition was simply to wait until the next scheduled update to fix vulnerabilities, leaving people exposed to risk for weeks on end. We didn’t believe that was good enough.</p><p>So, we started to ship fixes as soon as an issue was discovered. We shared what was found and the solution we applied. We went a step further, creating the industry’s first bug bounty program. We actively encouraged people to find vulnerabilities within Firefox, to share them with us so we could fix them and rewarded them when they did so. This is now the industry standard.</p><p>That openness and willingness to put the safety and interests of people first is how we built the trust we now enjoy. And it is how we will approach new opportunities to set better standards for the internet. In AI certainly, but also in society, where an organization owned by a not-for-profit has an opportunity to radically change the incentives that have so corrupted social to date, also in data, we must recognize that our own approach has to evolve.</p><p>If we are going to build great products, compelling products that people around the world use and enjoy, and through those products, we force others to improve their behaviors; we need to understand what people think of and want from the products we build. The only way to do that is through data. We need a signal to know what’s working and to give us the intelligence to know when rapid iteration is needed.</p><p>This requires rich data, and so we will be moving in that direction, but in a very Mozilla way, always prioritizing user privacy and leveraging the latest in encryption and other protective measures. As we did with bugs, we will look not to follow the practices of the industry and they exist today but to set new and better ones.</p><p>So, we have a busy year ahead of us. This report will give you a taste of our ambitions and how we plan to pursue them. It should also remind you that Mozilla, even after 25 years of doing so, remains a vital force for building a better Internet.</p><p>As we move forward, let’s remember that our greatest strength lies not in our size or our technological prowess but in our commitment to making the internet a better place for all. It is this shared mission, this collective drive, that will propel us to even greater heights in the coming years. Mozilla is, and always has been, the people’s platform.</p>'
