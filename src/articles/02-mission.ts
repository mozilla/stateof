  excerpt: 'We remain big believers in the power of technology to transform the world for good, but we know that won’t happen without a concerted cross-industry effort. Mozilla is the right company to lead that charge.',
  body: '<h3>Mozilla Expands its Influence for the Age of AI</h3><p>The technology world is careening into a new era in which AI will dramatically transform our relationship with the Internet even as social networks tear up the fabric of society. The decisions we make as an industry will determine whether this new era serves the interests of the public good or the interests of big tech. Mozilla has a long history of taking on entrenched players to fight for openness and end-user rights, and we have evolved our strategy in recent years to address the urgent new challenges. We remain big believers in the power of technology to transform the world for good, but we know that won’t happen without a concerted cross-industry effort. Mozilla is the right company to lead that charge</p><p>As part of those efforts, this year we launched a new venture arm and an AI research company to help us shape and influence fast-emerging areas of tech that threaten the public good. Our core mission remains the same -- to fight for an open Internet that ensures competition and puts people over profit -- but we are broadening our scope to address the urgent challenges that AI and social media present.</p><p>Mozilla will continue to build and evolve all the products you know and love, like Firefox and Thunderbird, but we have moved into new areas to meet these new challenges. This required us to build whole new initiatives and to take some big risks, but we are confident that two overarching strategies will continue to serve us well and allow us to meet our goals: shaping markets and fueling movements.</p><p>On the market side, we build world-class responsible tech products like Firefox, which give hundreds of millions of people a way to choose a better internet everyday — and push the rest of the market to do better. This is an example of how we use the market to advance our mission, and it’s why we have many new responsible tech products in the works right now.</p><p>To further influence the market, we launched Mozilla Ventures to support startups that are building technologies that align with our mission to put people first. We set up an initial $35 million fund for early-stage responsible startups, talked to hundreds of companies and invested in 24 founders.</p><h4>And we’ve only just begun.</h4><p>At the same time, we’ve expanded our efforts to build movements and bring others along. We launched a new company, Mozilla.ai, which is both a startup and a community creating the tools and technologies needed to build powerful but ethical AI products that put people first. Mozilla.ai will focus on open source LLMs and other building blocks that will be needed to ensure a competitive market and allow developers to build trustworthy AI products at scale. Our goal is to set the direction for a more open and competitive AI ecosystem.</p><p>We are also extending our research efforts to uncover the harmful side of products in the market and apply public pressure to do better. For example, our YouTube Regrets crowdsourced research campaign uncovered thousands of instances where YouTube users were fed recommended content featuring misinformation and other harmful messages that violated the site’s own policies. Our Privacy Not Included campaigns revealed issues with Tinder, TikTok and other widely used consumer products. So far, we’ve run dozens of campaigns to get the public talking about what’s broken online — and demanding a better way.</p><p>We partner with like-minded activists, artists, engineers and others who are thinking of ways to build trustworthy AI — and we were proud to see five of the individuals we invested in named in the Time 100 this year. After three years of pandemic-era virtual events, we launched two pop-up Mozfest events in collaboration with local communities— in Amsterdam and Nairobi, which was the first Mozfest on the African continent. And we organized the Responsible AI and Mradi Innovation challenges, demonstrating our power to draw people together.</p><p>Finally, we advocate to governments for greater transparency in AI systems, a requirement that was written into EU law with the AI ACT, while influencing the EU’s Digital Services Act, which was passed this year.</p><p>The combination of employing both markets and movements is our superpower: All the pieces of Mozilla — consumer products, movement building, investing, R&D -- combine to achieve more than the sum of their parts. We build products that show what’s possible and we build movements to help others do the same. This is what makes Mozilla unique.</p><p>Our objective is to provide better ways to live online, and to do this we compete with the tech giants. It’s not easy, but we don’t need to beat these companies or control the market to achieve our aims: We just need enough people to choose alternatives to demonstrate that a better way is possible.</p>'
