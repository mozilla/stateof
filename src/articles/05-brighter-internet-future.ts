  body: '<h4>At Mozilla, our quest is rooted in our deep commitment to forging a better internet and placing people at the forefront of our mission. Unlike traditional technology corporations, we intertwine business with purpose, seeing our operations as a means to connect with people, enrich their lives, and contribute to a brighter internet future.</h4><blockquote>Unlike traditional technology corporations, we intertwine business with purpose, seeing our operations as a means to connect with people, enrich their lives, and contribute to a brighter internet future.</blockquote><p>Our unique structure, encompassing a non-profit organization and a for-profit company, coupled with a vibrant global community, positions us uniquely to achieve our mission. The Mozilla Foundation, the sole owner of the Mozilla Corporation, enables us to prioritize internet users’ welfare over profit-driven motives.</p><p>In 2022, and continuing into 2023, we made significant progress against our core investment strategy — diversification. We define diversification broadly: yes, it’s about new product features — but also new products, new companies under the Mozilla umbrella, and investments in companies in the broader tech ecosystem that share our values and perspective.</p><p>Our focus on diversification is obviously important to our financial outlook, but it is also critical to our efforts to fulfill our mission. We make a better internet by being present and creating better experiences across the internet, in areas like shopping, social and AI. That dual focus — financial health and mission progress — continues to make Mozilla unique, and means that we will continue to make decisions that put people over profit.</p><p>Our diversification journey is not limited to the activities of the Corporation. We have invested a total of $35 million in creating both Mozilla AI and Mozilla Ventures.</p><p>This growth helps us continue to spotlight and invest in the people who are building a better internet, including trustworthy AI. It also helps us mobilize thousands of people through our advocacy work, so that we can work together to spotlight poor practices in tech, such as YouTube algorithms driving misinformation.</p><p>And that work is why it’s so important that we can say: our finances are strong</p><img class="hidden md:block w-full mb-10 max-w-[950px] mx-auto" loading="lazy" src="/2023/finance-graphic.png"/><img class="block md:hidden w-full mb-10 max-w-[390px] mx-auto" loading="lazy" src="/2023/finance-graphic-mobile.png"/><p>Mozilla’s total assets, valued at over $1 billion, underscore both robust financial health and the health of our mission. Mozilla’s journey in 2023 is a testament to our unwavering commitment to creating a safer, user-centric internet. It’s also a testament to the relevance of our efforts, our products, and the strength of the community we continue to build around us.</p><p>Our approach in the technology sector is unconventional. We prioritize people over profits. By focusing on privacy and ethical AI, we make choices that may limit immediate financial gains but steadfastly align with our core values. Our venture arm is committed to supporting startups that amplify our mission-driven ethos.</p><p>What distinguishes us is our pursuit of mission-aligned equity, not just profitability. We view business as a powerful tool for effecting change and advancing our mission. This involves engaging investors and partners to support our entire portfolio, ensuring a strong and secure foundation for future growth. We are committed to investing in products that enhance lives, align with our mission, and build a movement to reclaim the internet.</p><p>Attracting and retaining users is also fundamental to our long-term success. We understand the importance of a positive initial customer experience, and as such, we are continually enhancing our Desktop and Mobile products to attract new users and retain our existing user base. By leveraging data-driven insights and implementing product improvements, we aim to reduce churn and provide a seamless, enriching online experience that meets the needs and expectations of our users.</p><p>Our commitment to ethical advertising is deeply rooted in our mission at Mozilla. Recognizing the necessity of a digital advertising platform that aligns with our values, we are currently developing a system that emphasizes user privacy, transparency, and ethical practices. This investment is a testament to our unwavering dedication to cultivating a trustworthy online environment, where both advertisers and users can thrive in a transparent and ethical digital space.</p><p>Regarding our corporate capitalization, over the past two years, we’ve recalibrated our approach to align our asset stewardship with our long-term financial support for our mission, always ensuring alignment with our core principles. This recalibration includes adopting a quasi-endowment approach to managing our overall cash and marketable securities, aiming for an optimized balance of risk and return. We’ve also implemented a framework to track the mission alignment of our investments, responsibly vote our proxies, and weigh the trade-offs between mission and return</p><p>Our commitment to financial responsibility with the goal of achieving the mission is prevalent throughout our financial decisions in the Mozilla Foundation</p><p>Mozilla investigates and amplifies issues at the intersection of technology and society, introducing vital topics into the public discourse. In 2022, we released our annual Internet Health Report, which interrogated how AI is impacting healthcare, labor, and other domains. We also published incisive research into how tech platforms affect everything from fair elections, to consumer rights. In 2022, Mozilla spent over $1.4 million to support its agenda-setting work.</p><p>Mozilla provides fellowships and awards to people on the front lines of the internet health movement, adding much-needed momentum while also building a global community of like-minded thinkers. We launched the Mozilla Tech Fund to reduce bias and increase transparency in AI. Our Africa Innovation Mradi work continued to lift digital rights and social justice activists across the African continent. And our creative media award recipients launched several projects examining how data flows online. In 2022, Mozilla spent $14 million to support its leadership development work.</p><p>Mozilla rallies millions of internet users together to hold big tech companies accountable and champion individual agency online. In 2022, we published multiple editions of our *Privacy Not Included buyer’s guide, empowering consumers to choose apps, gadgets, and other connected products that respect their privacy and security. We reached 100 languages in our Common Voice initiative, which is the most diverse crowdsourced dataset in the world.  Mozilla spent $6.5 million to support its movement-building work.</p><p>In summary, our advancements over the last year demonstrate our commitment to continuing to grow and evolve as an organization, underscoring our unwavering commitment to creating a safer, more transparent and user-centric internet.</p>'
