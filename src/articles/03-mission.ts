  body: '<h4>The technology world is entering a new era in which AI will dramatically transform our relationship with the internet even as social networks continue to tear up the fabric of democracies. The decisions we make as a society will determine whether this new era serves the interests of the public good or the interests of a small handful of huge technology companies.</h4><p>We remain big believers in the power of technology to transform the world for good — and that nonprofit public benefit organizations like Mozilla play a key role in making this happen. We know that won’t happen without continuing to evolve our focus and organization. This includes building out new capabilities and adding talent across our portfolio — including adding people who bring new skills and experiences to our Boards.</p><p>Mozilla’s core capabilities have always included a mix of being able to shape the market with responsible tech products and being able to gather a movement of people building and advocating for a better internet.</p><p>Shaping the market means making responsible tech products that hundreds of millions of people want to use — and that, in turn, others in the industry have to emulate. Firefox and Thunderbird had this kind of impact over the last 25 years, giving people the choice of products that include privacy by design, and pushing other players to prioritize privacy as well. As we carefully introduce AI capabilities into our core products, we have a chance to do this again — showing that products using AI can be trustworthy, empowering and delightful all at once. The FakeSpot shopping features coming to Firefox in 2024 are an example.</p><blockquote>We remain big believers in the power of technology to transform the world for good, but we know that won’t happen without a concerted cross-industry effort. Mozilla is the right company to lead that charge.</blockquote><p>As we look to the future, it’s become clear that we need more ways to shape how the market for tech works — and in particular, to push AI in a more trustworthy direction.</p>With this goal in mind, we launched a new company, Mozilla.ai, which aims to create core AI technology that is at once trustworthy, open source and useful to people everywhere. Mozilla.ai’s initial focus is on building tools that make open source LLMs more accurate, safe and easy to deploy. These tools serve as building blocks that are needed to ensure a competitive market and allow developers to build trustworthy AI products at scale. If successful, this work will shape how the market develops, creating a more open and competitive AI ecosystem.<p></p><div class="flex flex-col md:flex-row items-start justify-between gap-[70px] mt-[100px]"><div class="relative w-full"><svg class="md:absolute top-0 right-0 w-full translate-x-5 md:translate-z-0 md:w-[450px]" viewBox="0 0 458 437" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g style="mix-blend-mode:multiply" opacity="0.5"><path d="M345 264.5C345 359.769 267.769 437 172.5 437C77.2309 437 2.37658e-05 359.769 1.54371e-05 264.5L5.77693e-06 154L345 154L345 264.5Z" fill="#48EA83"/></g><g style="mix-blend-mode:multiply"><path d="M457.115 153.5L226.999 307L226.999 -2.01174e-05L457.115 153.5Z" fill="#48EA83"/></g><rect opacity="0.7" x="50" y="85" width="138" height="138" rx="69" fill="#48EA83"/></svg></div><div class="md:w-2/3 shrink-0"><p>Over the past year, we also expanded our market shaping efforts by launching Mozilla Ventures to support startups that are building technologies that align with our mission to put people first. The initial $35 million fund is focused on early-stage responsible startups, focused on trustworthy AI, privacy and security and healthy online communities. So far, we have invested in over 30 startups. Together, they offer an example of how we could be building tech differently from the ground up — and point towards the potential of a different kind of tech industry</p><p>Movement building also remains key to who Mozilla is — working with communities around the world who are building and advocating for a better internet.</p><pOver the past year, we extended our research efforts to uncover the harmful side of products in the market and apply public pressure to do better. For example, our YouTube Regrets crowdsourced research campaign gathered a community of over 50,000 people to uncover places where the YouTube feed recommended content featuring misinformation and other harmful messages that violated the site’s own policies. Our *Privacy Not Included campaigns revealed issues with Tinder, TikTok and other widely used consumer products. So far, we’ve run dozens of campaigns to get the public talking about what’s broken online — and demanding a better way.</p><p>We also continued to partner with like-minded activists, artists, engineers and others who are thinking of ways to build trustworthy AI — and we were proud to see two of the individuals we invested in named in the Time 100 this year. After three years of pandemic-era virtual events, we launched two pop-up Mozfest events in collaboration with local communities — in Amsterdam and Nairobi, which was the first Mozfest on the African continent. And we organized the Responsible AI and Mradi Innovation challenges, demonstrating our power to draw people together.</p><p>Finally, we have doubled down our efforts to help governments roll out tech regulation that balances innovation and the public interest. Over the past year, this included successfully advocating for stronger transparency provisions as part of the EU’s AI Act and its Digital Services Act. In the year ahead, we will increase our focus on AI regulation even further, with a particular focus on ensuring that open source and open markets are protected in an era where the big AI players are already starting to consolidate things.</p><p>We’ve also been focused over the last year on evolving the team that brings these capabilities to life — including our Boards. With this report, we’re announcing that Emerson Collective CTO Raffi Krikorian, CTO, former Deputy Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy Alondra Nelson, former Managing Director at Dalberg Edwin Macharia and International Rescue Committee Chief Marketing Officer Zain Haboo are joining the Mozilla Foundation Board. This new slate of Board members bring expertise in AI and connections to communities impacted by AI.</p><p>The combination of employing both markets and movements is our superpower: All the pieces of Mozilla — consumer products, movement building, investing, R&D — combine to achieve more than the sum of their parts. We build products that show what’s possible, and we build movements to help others do the same. This is what makes Mozilla unique.</p><p>Our objective is to provide better ways to live online, and to do this, we compete with the tech giants. It’s not easy, but we don’t need to beat these companies or control the market to achieve our aims: We just need enough people to choose alternatives to demonstrate that a better way is possible.</p></div></div>'
