  body: '<h3>Deepening our Global Advocacy Program</h3><p>Six years ago I was tasked with building Mozilla’s advocacy program, a new tool in Mozilla’s toolbox. We took a clear focus, mobilizing the public to help us bring about change to consumer products and government policies to better serve the people who use technology. We have held technology providers to account with research that exposes how their products work against the interests of consumers. Over the past year we have taken a more formalized approach to our advocacy work and seen our efforts blossom and effect real change</p><p>There have been many naysayers who told us that tech giants would not respond to public pressure, and frankly we were unsure if our efforts would succeed. But big tech is growing ever more powerful, and AI has opened a new front in the battle for a fair and equitable Internet. We forged ahead, took risks and experimented with different models of engagement, and we have seen how our advocacy work can lead to real change.</p><blockquote>Mozilla is in a unique position among advocacy groups because we build products in addition to guiding others in how to build them.</blockquote><p>We’re not looking in from the outside; we make products that comply with our own guidance, showing what’s possible and leading by example. We’re coming up with standards of practice based on our own experience that we must also follow ourselves.</p><p>We’ve influenced product improvements with our work, particularly our *Privacy Not Included campaigns. We took a deep dive into mental health apps and found glaring security and privacy problems, including that many app providers continue to share sensitive data with third parties without warning consumers. Soon after, Sen. Elizabeth Warren and others <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/23/23179866/elizabeth-warren-betterhelp-talkspace-therapy-pandemic-app-philip-defranco" target="_blank">sent letters</a> demanding to know what these apps will do to protect user privacy. The FTC is now looking at the issue. In a more recent report, we investigated connected car systems and found the state of privacy to be even worse.</p><p>We’re very active in pursuing public policy changes that will force tech companies to make changes that better protect consumer data and rights. Alphabet’s decision to provide researchers with <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/blog/a-win-for-data-access-voluntary-becomes-mandatory-at-youtube/" target="_blank">access to crucial YouTube data</a> showing how its algorithm works came from requirements in the EU’s Digital Services Act, which we held workshops on in Brussels and lobbied for for years. In France, we launched a campaign against a bill that would force browsers to censor websites. Our petition opposing the measure was signed by 750,000 people and resulted in an amendment to a French bill to address our specific concerns. SREN DOC In the United States, we <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/openforum/article/reproductive-rights-california-tech-17925695.php" target="_blank">advocated passage</a> of California’s AB254, to prevent tracking of women’s reproductive and sexual health data. It was later signed into law.</p><h4>We have also pioneered new approaches to public interest research</h4><p>In June, we launched the <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/blog/mozilla-launches-open-source-research-investigations-team-to-probe-platform-algorithms-ai-globally/" target="_blank">Open Source Research and Investigations</a> team. Their work will largely be community-driven, leveraging crowdsourced data donations — a novel and effective approach in the public interest research field. This collaborative approach was used to create the Common Voice project, in which people from around the globe provided sample audio of them speaking to help expand the languages represented in speech recognition applications.</p><p>Also this year, TikTok <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/blog/taking-tiktok-to-task-on-ad-transparency/" target="_blank">released an API</a> that allows researchers to study its ad archive to understand who is paying for ads on its platform. Our initial focus in this area will be scrutinizing video content on TikTok, Instagram and YouTube, and social media platform integrity ahead of the elections. Thiswork  will be especially important in non-English speaking countries where resources to investigate election misinformation are often lacking.</p><p>More broadly, we’re pursuing a new model for advocacy that we believe can be replicated in other sectors outside of tech, such as climate change and global health issues. Advocacy groups often work in opposition to industry; by contrast, Mozilla works to enable entrepreneurs and technologists to succeed, but in a way that promotes fair competition and the public good.</p><p>This is what makes us unique and will be our strength as we continue to shape the digital landscape through advocacy. Mozilla has always been a champion of technology, and we will continue to influence the industry from the inside even as we pursue our advocacy work worldwide to build the safe, trustworthy Internet that people deserve.</p>'
