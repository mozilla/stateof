  excerpt:
    "Being named a MozillaRise 25 honoree was incredibly validating and so very special. In particular, to me, it represented an affirmation of the need for more young people, especially young women of color (and other individuals from historically underrepresented backgrounds) leading the charge towards realizing a more safe, kind internet. So much of what’s made my work so effective is rooted in my perspective as a young person -- and there are so many more young people out there with amazing ideas to build a better internet. I hope that this recognition inspires them to bring those ideas to life.",
