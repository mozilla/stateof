  excerpt:
    "Becoming a Mozilla Rise25 honoree is a profound affirmation of standing on the shoulders of my ancestors’ wildest dreams. It’s a recognition of the legacy of black women who, throughout history, have been silently changing the world, yet often overlooked. Working with Mozilla means seizing the opportunity to amplify these voices, to ensure that our contributions are not only acknowledged but celebrated. The Rise25 award ceremony in Berlin was a poignant reminder that we are not alone in this journey. Together, we continue to shatter barriers and pave the way for a future where all black women in tech are seen, heard, and honored.",
