  body: '<p>Over her 25+ years working in the US & India, Mozilla’s SVP of Strategy & Operations, Suba Vasudevan, has managed global organizations in trust & safety, customer support, content moderation, strategy, & analytics, as well as risk consulting and a brief stint in journalism. This has allowed her to develop a unique perspective around systems thinking, the intersection of business and technology, societal issues, and how to balance risk and growth mindsets. She has also always been an advocate and leader in the DEI space particularly sponsoring Women’s business resource groups throughout her career.</p><p>About joining Mozilla, Suba says, “I am excited to be embracing a new journey with a commitment to openness and innovation. I have led multiple purpose-driven global organizations (from incubation/seed stages to growth and scale) and hope to bring my decades of experiences from Meta, KPMG, and others, to Mozilla during this pivotal time for the company.</p><p>My role here may be multi-fold but follows the same arc of developing sound operational muscle/ excellence and focus as a company, which starts with company strategy, flows into good planning, and operations enabled by business analytics.</p><p>My 11-year tenure at Meta was marked by truly motivating work, especially in areas like trust & safety, customer support operations, and content moderation that powered AI. But I am here now because Mozilla offers a unique proposition that I want to do my part in enabling further; the promise of a more open, safe, and privacy-oriented Internet.”</p>'
