  excerpt: 'I am excited to be embracing a new journey with a commitment to openness and innovation.',
  body: '<p>Over my 25+ years working in the US and India, I, have managed global organizations in diverse areas such as trust and safety, customer support, content moderation, strategy and analytics, and risk consulting, along with a brief stint in journalism. This diverse professional journey has enabled me to develop a unique perspective that intertwines systems thinking, the intersection of business and technology, societal issues, and the balance between risk and growth mindsets. Throughout my career, advocating for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) has been a passion of mine, especially in championing Women’s business resource groups.</p><p>Joining Mozilla marks an exciting new chapter in my journey. I am thrilled to be part of an organization committed to openness and innovation. Having led multiple purpose-driven global organizations, from their incubation and seed stages to their growth and scaling phases, I look forward to bringing my wealth of experience from my time at Meta, KPMG, and other companies to Mozilla during this pivotal period for the company. My goal is to contribute significantly to Mozilla’s ongoing evolution and help steer it towards new horizons of success and impact in the tech world.</p><p>My role here may be multi-fold but follows the same arc of developing sound operational muscle/ excellence and focus as a company, which starts with company strategy, flows into good planning, and operations enabled by business analytics.</p><p>My 11-year tenure at Meta was marked by truly motivating work, especially in areas like trust & safety, customer support operations, and content moderation that powered AI. But I am here now because Mozilla offers a unique proposition that I want to do my part in enabling further; the promise of a more open, safe, and privacy-oriented Internet.”</p>'
