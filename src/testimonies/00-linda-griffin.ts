  excerpt: '<blockquote>Our aim is not just to develop products that people can trust but to build movements that give voice to the views of those people.</blockquote>',
  body: '<p>My working life has been driven by two passionate beliefs: that both international politics and tech, have unrivaled potential to be forces for good in the world. In fact, the more that’s put into doubt, the stronger my commitment has been to making it happen.</p><p>Mozilla has been part of the fabric of the internet since its beginning. From the days of Web 1.0, Mozilla has been the heart and soul of our technological revolution. Today, Mozilla’s work spreads well beyond the internet of the last century, bringing with it a diversity of approaches and views from across the Corporation, the Foundation, Mozilla Ventures and <a href="https://mozilla.ai/" target="_blank">Mozilla.ai</a>.</p><p>Concepts like security and privacy are sometimes mere buzzwords in the broader tech ecosystem. At Mozilla, they’re not just an afterthought. They are at the core of everything we build – from Firefox, to our communities. Our aim is not just to develop products that people can trust, but to build movements that give voice to the views of those people.</p><p>The mission has always been to keep the internet as an open, global, public resource with opportunities for community and collaboration — for all. And that’s precisely the mission I’ve been looking for.</p><p>The depth and breadth of Mozilla’s work with governments, policymakers and regulators has been without parallel. However, I am reminded daily that our values and commitments make our policy work uniquely difficult. And it’s getting harder.</p><p>I salute Mozillians past and present who have contributed to this effort. My new role, operating across all Mozilla entities, builds on all of their work. I know that together, we can achieve more than ever for internet users everywhere.</p>'
