  excerpt: 'Carlos Torres joined the team in August as Chief Legal Officer.',
  body: '<p>Sulafa currently leads DEIB (Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging) at the Mozilla Foundation, with a strong focus on promoting harm awareness and creating a harm-reductive environment.</p><p>Her decision to join Mozilla was founded on the principle of nurturing inclusive digital champions who are dedicated to the convergence of building a world characterized by trustworthy AI and supporting marginalized digital communities through continuous learning and growth. The organization is committed to experimentation, embracing growth, and refining its strategies in the ever-evolving digital landscape.</p><p>Sulafa’s journey began in multimedia journalism, recognizing the inextricable link between technology and journalism. Her career led her to work with UN agencies and with international organizations across Africa, Asia, and Europe, including a pivotal role with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation’s inaugural African-wide human capacity building program, the AWARD Fellowship. Collaborating with various organizations, she focused on enhancing communication strategies and capacity-building initiatives, with a strong emphasis on social inclusivity and impact. Notably, she co-created educational tools with youth in the UK as part of the groundbreaking Digital Disruption project, addressing digital propaganda and misinformation related to radicalization.</p><p>“Mozilla’s work is deeply connected to social impact and social wellbeing of marginalized - it is rooted in the integration in elevating voices of the voiceless and showcasing that you can be both responsible and fiscally ambitious”</p><p>In 2018, she founded Dawa Apothecary, a borderless health & wellness platform dedicated to empowering women of colour. Her vision centers on amplifying the voices of marginalized individuals, both professionally and within the sanctuary of their homes, earning her recognition on the ’How I Made It’ list of the top 50 millennial women to watch in Canada.</p><p>Previously, Sulafa assumed the role of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) and Culture leader at Weston Foods creating a psychologically safe and equitable workplace environment spanning the United States and Canada. Sulafa Silim is deeply committed to the power of storytelling in fostering connections and bridging gaps while building equitable workplaces.</p>`'
