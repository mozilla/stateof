  excerpt:
    "What attracted Steve to this role was Mozilla Foundation’s dedication to advancing equity.",
  body: "<p>Over the past decade, I, have dedicated myself to educating students across all levels, from kindergarten to graduate school, on how to use, develop, and critically evaluate technology. My journey in the realm of technology education has now led me to Mozilla, where I serve as the Program Lead for the Responsible Computing Challenge. In this role, I am focusing on supporting instructors and professors at Higher Education institutions to integrate responsible computing practices into their curricula.</p><p>What drew me to this position at Mozilla was the Foundation’s deep commitment to advancing equity. At Mozilla, technology is not perceived as a panacea or as something that operates independently of societal influences. Instead, it is understood as a reflection of many of society’s challenges and, in some cases, as a factor that can exacerbate existing inequalities. Through the Responsible Computing Challenge, I see a profound opportunity to address these potential harms. This initiative is about preparing the next generation of technologists to think critically and be aware of the issues that often disproportionately harm the most vulnerable communities.</p><p>I am enthusiastic about the potential growth of the program. In the next few years, I look forward to seeing the Responsible Computing Challenge expand its reach to new regions and be incorporated into more courses. This expansion represents not just the growth of the program but also the advancement of a critical and conscientious approach to technology development and use, which is crucial in our increasingly digital world.</p>",
